______Programming errors I made along the way______
- trying to initialize strings to NULL, when string are objects in CPP and not
    pointers
- forgetting to pass a parameter in my function call
- forgetting end of line semicolon;
- spending too long trying to make the code look prettier and more modular when
    there is only so modular I can make it without structs or objects when I
    need to keep track of multiple variables. and bitswapping on the first
    project is overkill. (WAIT - I can pass by reference!)
- I don't need to santize inputs with the same level of vigilance if used to
    from C because cin is really pretty great about doing that for me
- returning the wrong variable
