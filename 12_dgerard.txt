______Programming errors I made along the way______
>> Careless / trivial errors
- Trying to initialize strings to NULL, when string are objects in CPP and not
    pointers.
- Forgetting to pass a parameter in my function call.
- Forgetting end of line semicolon.
>> Bugs caused by bad habits && how to correct them
- Returning the wrong variable - makes sure that when I write a function, the
    first thing I write is the initialization of the return variable and the
    reuturn statement.
- Forgetting to return 0 from the end of main, and forgetting to return; from
    void functions - make sure that I write a return statement at the end of
    each function and main as one of the first thing I do when writing a
    function
- Using magic numbers - replacing them with global const variables
- Using single letter indexes - replacing with descriptive ones
- Trying to do conversion between int/long and float/double. Instead, I should
    write code from the beginning to avoid float/double if possible.
