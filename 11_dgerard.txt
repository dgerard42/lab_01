_____ Algorithm for the Nth smallest number in array _____
With a Max Heap
1. Create an array of N pointers for a heap
2. Traverse through the array of M numbers
3. For each number in the array, compare it to to the top number in the heap
4. If the heap is empty, place the array number at the top of the heap
5. Else, if the current array number is smaller than the top heap number, place the new number
    at the top of the heap, and shift all lower elements of the heap down, removing the lowest
    element.
6. Else, if the number is larger, traverse down the heap until N elements of the heap have been
    traversed through and checked against. If any of the numbers in the heap are higher than
    the current array number, then place the new array number into a node above that number,
    move down all the lower elements in the heap, and take the highest number off the end.
7. The number at the bottom of the heap at the end of this proccess will be the Nth smallest
    number in the array.
