_____ Algorithm for a phonebook _____
Creating the database and entering data
1. Create an array of 1024 pointers
2. For each entry, allocate a linked list node and put data inside
4. Add all characters in the name together, and then modulo by 1024
5. Go to the pointer indexed at the number calculated in step 4
6. Set that pointer to point to your new linked list node
7. If there is already node(s) pointed to by the pointer, traverse to the end of the linked list
    and add the new node to the end
Retrieving data
1. User enters the name of the person whose number they are searching for
2. Add all of the ascii character numbers of the name together and then modulo by 1024
3. Go to the pointer at the index for the result of step 2
4. Traverese through the linked list nodes at that pointer until matching name is found
5. Print the number associated with that name
